/**
 * Represents a (server) runtime type from which runtime instances can be
 * created.
 * <p>
 * The server core framework supports
 * an open-ended set of runtime types, which are contributed via
 * the <code>runtimeTypes</code> extension point in the server core
 * plug-in. Runtime type objects carry no state (all information is
 * read-only and is supplied by the server runtime type declaration).
 * The global list of known runtime types is available via
 * {@link ServerCore#getRuntimeTypes()}.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * This interface is not intended to be implemented by clients.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * [issue: The term "runtime" is misleading, given that the main
 * reason is for build time classpath contributions, not for actually
 * running anything. "libraries" might be a better choice.]
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * [issue: What value do runtimes add?
 * It's main role is for setting up the Java build classpath
 * for projects holding modules that must be Java compiled.
 * If the notion of module is to transcend the vagaries of particular
 * types of server, and, indeed, be published to multiple servers
 * simultaneously, then matters of build classpath had better not
 * be tied to the particular servers involved.]
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * [issue: It is notoriously difficult to place any kind of
 * useful order on objects that are contributed independently by
 * non-collaborating parties. The IOrdered mechanism is weak, and
 * can't really solve the problem. Issues of presentation are usually
 * best left to the UI, which can sort objects based on arbitrary
 * properties.]
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * [issue: Equality/identify for runtime types? Are IRuntimeType
 * instances guaranteed to be canonical (client can use ==),
 * or is it possible for there to be non-identical IRuntimeType
 * objects in play that both represent the same runtime type?
 * The latter is the more common; type should spec equals.]
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <it>Caveat: The server core API is still in an early form, and is
 * likely to change significantly before the initial release.</it>
