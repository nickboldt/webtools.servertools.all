<p>SPI support for the server tools framework.</p>

<p>The classes in this package would typically be extended or used by
SPI clients of the server tools framework who are providing a new server
type, runtime type, or other extension. These delegates are never visible
to regular API clients unless explicitly exposed by the provider.</p>

<p>The majority of these classes are delegates to implement one of the
extension points. View the extension point documentation for further
details.</p>
