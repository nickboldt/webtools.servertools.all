/**
 * Represents a runtime instance. Every runtime is an instance of a
 * particular, fixed runtime type.
 * <p>
 * Servers have a runtime. The server runtime corresponds to the
 * installed code base for the server. The main role played by the server
 * runtime is in identifying code libraries to compile or build against.
 * In the case of local servers, the server runtime may play a secondary role
 * of being used to launch the server for testing. Having the server runtimes
 * identified as an entity separate from the server itself facilitates sharing
 * server runtimes between several servers.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * [issue: As mentioned in an issue on IRuntimeType, the term "runtime"
 * is misleading, given that the main reason is for build time classpath
 * contributions, not for actually running anything. "libraries" might be a
 * better choice.]
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The resource manager maintains a global list of all known runtime instances
 * ({@link IResourceManager#getRuntimes()}).
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * [issue: Equality/identify for runtimes?]
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>This interface is not intended to be implemented by clients.</p>
 * <p>
 * <it>Caveat: The server core API is still in an early form, and is
 * likely to change significantly before the initial release.</it>
