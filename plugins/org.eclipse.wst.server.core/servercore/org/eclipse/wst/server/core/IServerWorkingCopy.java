/**
 * A working copy server object used for formulating changes

 * <p>
 * [issue: The default value of runtime should be specified
 * here (or in IServerType.createServer). If the initial value is null (or
 * something simularly unsuitable for actual use), then IServer.getRuntime
 * needs to be spec'd to allow null return (it does), and save needs to deal

 * [issue: IElementWorkingCopy and IElement support an open-ended set
 * of attribute-value pairs. What is relationship between these
 * attributes and (a) the get/setXXX methods found on this interface,
 * and (b) get/setXXX methods provided by specific server types?
 * Is it the case that these attribute-values pairs are the only
 * information about a server instance that can be preserved
 * between workbench sessions? That is, any information recorded
 * just in instance fields of an ServerDelegate implementation
 * will be lost when the session ends.]
 * </p>

 * [issue: It seems strange that IServerWorkingCopy extends IServer, which
 * has all sorts of method for starting and stopping the server, none of
 * which are relevant to working copies. It should be changed so
 * that IServerWorkingCopy does not extend IServer. This will requires
 * copying getters from IServer to IServerWorkingCopy to make it
 * self-sufficient: getHostname, getServerConfiguration, getRuntime, getId,
 * getFile, getServerType, etc.]
