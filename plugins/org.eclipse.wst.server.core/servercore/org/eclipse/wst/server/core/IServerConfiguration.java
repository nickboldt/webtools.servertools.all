/**
 * Represents a server configuration instance. Every server configuration is an
 * instance of a particular, fixed server configuration type.
 * <p>
 * Servers have an optional server configuration. The server configuration is
 * information used to configure a running server. Simple types of servers
 * might not require any configuration, whereas full-featured web server have
 * an extensive set of parameters for adjusting the server's behavior. Even
 * though server configuration information usually takes the form of one or
 * more files, configuration information is treated separately from actual
 * content. Actual web content can be deployed on different servers without
 * change, whereas server configuration information is usually highly
 * dependent on the particulars of the server. Having the server configuration
 * identified as an entity separate from the server itself facilitates
 * switching an existing server between configurations, and sharing server
 * configurations between several servers of the same type (e.g., a local test
 * server and a remote server running on another host). * </p>
 * <p>
 * The resource manager maintains a global list of all known server 
 * configuration instances ({@link IResourceManager#getServerConfigurations()}).
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * [issue: The information actually stored in the (.config) file is:
 * server configuration id and name, and server configuration type id.
 * It's unclear what's gained by storing this
 * information in a workspace file. Is it so that this information
 * can be shared between users via a repository? Or is it just so that
 * there would be something to open in the resource navigator view?]
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * [issue: What is the role of the data files in the configuration
 * data folder? Where do they come from? Are they created by the
 * client (UI), or do they get created automatically?]
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * [issue: Are data files ever changed as a direct and immediate
 * result of a change to a working copy? Changing any of the data
 * files prior to the save() request would be problematic since
 * these files are shared by the original. The only way it could
 * work is to the data files to be updated only when a working copy
 * is saved.]
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * [issue: Equality/identify for server configurations?]
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>This interface is not intended to be implemented by clients.</p>
 * <p>
 * <it>Caveat: The server core API is still in an early form, and is
 * likely to change significantly before the initial release.</it>
