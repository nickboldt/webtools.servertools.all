/**
 * Represents a server configuration type from which server configuration 
 * instances ({@link IServerConfiguration}) can be created.
 * <p>
 * The server core framework supports
 * an open-ended set of server configuration types, which are contributed via
 * the <code>serverConfigurationTypes</code> extension point in the server core
 * plug-in. Server configuration type objects carry no state (all information is
 * read-only and is supplied by the server configuration type declaration).
 * The global list of known server configuration types is available via
 * {@link ServerCore#getServerConfigurationTypes()}. 
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * This interface is not intended to be implemented by clients.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * [issue: It is notoriously difficult to place any kind of
 * useful order on objects that are contributed independently by
 * non-collaborating parties. The IOrdered mechanism is weak, and
 * can't really solve the problem. Issues of presentation are usually
 * best left to the UI, which can sort objects based on arbitrary
 * properties.]
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * [issue: Equality/identify for server types? Are IServerConfigurationType
 * instances guaranteed to be canonical (client can use ==),
 * or is it possible for there to be non-identical IServerConfigurationType
 * objects in play that both represent the same server configuration type?
 * The latter is the more common; type should spec equals.]
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <it>Caveat: The server core API is still in an early form, and is
 * likely to change significantly before the initial release.</it>
