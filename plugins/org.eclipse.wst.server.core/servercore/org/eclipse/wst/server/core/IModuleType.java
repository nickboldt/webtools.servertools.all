/**
 * Represents the type of a module.
 * <p>
 * [issue: This interface plays two roles. First, it is used
 * by the system to represent module type objects. Module
 * type objects are instances of the internal ModuleType class.
 * They get created for the "moduleType" elements of the
 * runtimeTypes and moduleFactories extension points.
 * The second role is that it is a superinterface of IModule,
 * the interface that represents module instances.
 * It would be clearer if it only played the former role.
 * IModule should instance have a getModuleType() method that
 * returns an IModuleType.]
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * [issue: It's confusing to have a type named IModuleKind as well.
 * The terminology should be "module types", to make it consistent with
 * server types, etc. On that reading, this interface would be named
 * IModuleType, and the existing one something else (if still needed).]
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * This interface is not intended to be implemented by clients.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <it>Caveat: The server core API is still in an early form, and is
 * likely to change significantly before the initial release.</it>
