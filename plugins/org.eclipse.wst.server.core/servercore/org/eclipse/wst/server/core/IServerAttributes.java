/**
 * Represents a server instance. Every server is an instance of a
 * particular, fixed server type.
 * <p>
 * Not surprisingly, the notion of <b>server</b> is central in the web tools
 * server infrastructure. In this context, understand that a server is
 * a web server of some ilk. It could be a simple web server lacking Java
 * support, or an J2EE based server, or perhaps even some kind of database
 * server. A more exact definition is not required for the purposes of this API.
 * From a tool-centric point of view, a server
 * is something that the developer is writing "content" for.
 * The unit of content is termed a module.
 * In a sense, the server exists, but lacks useful content. The
 * development task is to provide that content. The content can include
 * anything from simple, static HTML web pages to complex, highly dynamic
 * web applications.
 * In the course of writing and debugging this content,
 * the developer will want to test their content on a web server, to see how it
 * gets served up. For this they will need to launch a server process running on
 * some host machine (often the local host on which the IDE is running), or
 * attach to a server that's already running on a remote (or local) host. 
 * The newly developed content sitting in the developer's workspace needs to
 * end up in a location and format that the running server can use for its
 * serving purposes.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * In this picture, an <code>IServer</code> object is a proxy for the real web
 * server. Through this proxy, a client can configure the server, and start,
 * stop, and restart it.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The server framework maintains a global list of all known server instances
 * ({@link ServerCore#getServers()}).
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * [rough notes:
 * Server has a state.
 * Server can be started, stopped, and restarted.
 * To modify server attributes, get a working copy, modify it, and then save it
 * to commit the changes.
 * Server attributes. Serialization.
 * Chained working copies for runtime, server configuration.
 * Server has a set of root modules.
 * Modules have state wrt a server.
 * Restarting modules.
 * ]
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * [issue: The information actually stored in the (.server) file is:
 * server id and name, server type id, runtime id, server configuration id,
 * and test-environment. It's unclear what's gained by storing this
 * information in a workspace file. Is it so that this information
 * can be shared between users via a repository? Or is it just so that
 * there would be something to open in the resource navigator view?]
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * [issue: Equality/identify for servers?]
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>This interface is not intended to be implemented by clients.</p>
 * <p>
 * <it>Caveat: The server core API is still in an early form, and is
 * likely to change significantly before the initial release.</it>
