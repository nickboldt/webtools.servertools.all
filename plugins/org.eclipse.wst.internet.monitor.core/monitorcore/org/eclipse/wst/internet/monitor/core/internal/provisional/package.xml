<abstract>This package gives core (non-UI) access to the TCP/IP monitor. Clients can
query for existing monitors, create new monitors, start/stop monitors, and
listen for requests being received by a running monitor.</abstract>

<p>The MonitorCore class gives initial access to all of the API. From here you
can query the existing monitors, create new ones, and add/remove a listener for
monitor changes.</p>

<p>The IMonitor interface provides information about a particular monitor,
allowing you to change it via a working copy, start/stop it, or add a listener
for request activity.</p>
