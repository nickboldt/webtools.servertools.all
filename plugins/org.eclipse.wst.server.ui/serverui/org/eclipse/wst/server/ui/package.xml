<p>The server tools UI.</p>

<p>ServerUICore is the main entry-point for the API. From here, clients
can get the wizard pages for a particular server type, get a label
provider for all server types, or launch Run on Server directly.</p>

<p>ServerUIUtil provides utility methods. Currently, this is limited to
launching the server runtime wizard and editing an existing server
runtime.</p>

<p>ServerLaunchConfigurationTab is a generic server tools tab that can
be used in launch configuration tab groups for a server launch. It shows
information about the server to the user.</p>
