<h2>Package Specification for org.eclipse.wst.server.ui.wizard</h2>

<p>This package provides wizard and task support for the server tools UI.</p>

<p>WizardFragment is extended to provide a subtree of wizard pages or tasks
that can be inserted into a larger wizard flow. TaskWizard is the standard
wizard that knows how to handle WizardFragments and display them in order
within a single wizard. It uses the TaskWizardPages to display the wizard
fragment's composites within the wizard.</p>
